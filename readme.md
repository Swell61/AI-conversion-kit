#3D printed AI conversion kit for NIKKOR-H Auto 28mm f/3.5 (and probably others) 

Just modify the parameters and print in as good quality as you can.

I haven't tried it in any other lens, but it works on the 28mm


The .stl file is exported a bit bigger (see comment at line 1 of 28mm_f3.5.scad) as my printer tends to print a little fatter parts.
